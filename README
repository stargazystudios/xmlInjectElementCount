xmlInjectElementCount.pl README

Please see the inline comments for a detailed explanation of the logic.

The script parses a given XSD file, and an accompanying, conforming XML file. If any matching Processing Instructions are found in the XSD file (default name "elementCount"), then XML Elements in the scope specified, and with the name specified, are counted.

The parent Element of the Processing Instruction has the count injected into a named attribute. The purpose of this is to allow for the design of data in an object-oriented manner (XML), but then to store it statically to facilitate data-oriented processing at run-time. At run-time, the Element count can be used to initialise dynamic data structures, allocating the exact memory required, and avoiding resizing.

The files in this repository were created using the following command:
